My scene is a recreation of my bedroom through the use of unity assets. I've included many objects that would be found in a bedroom such as a bed, nightstand, and a desk with a computer setup. I was inspired from images of isographic rooms where two walls and the ceiling is cutout to allow for a full view of the room and the objects in the room and wanted to play around with layering so that in first person all the walls are presents but in orthographic, some objects are hidden to show the room clearly. The main character is the anime girl.
